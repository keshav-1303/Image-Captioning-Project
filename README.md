Sure! Here’s a clean, **short and to-the-point README code** for your *Image Captioning Project*:

````markdown
# 🖼️ Image Captioning Project

This project builds a model that generates captions for images using a CNN for feature extraction and an LSTM for sequence generation.

---

## ⚙️ Requirements

```bash
pip install tensorflow keras numpy matplotlib pillow nltk
````

---

## 🚀 Usage

1️⃣ Run the notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook ImageCaptioningProject.ipynb
```

2️⃣ The notebook will:

* Extract image features using a pre-trained CNN (e.g. VGG16/ResNet).
* Tokenize captions.
* Train an LSTM-based decoder.
* Generate captions for new images.

3️⃣ Example:

```python
caption = generate_caption(model, tokenizer, image_features)
print(caption)
```

---

## 💾 Save/Load Model

```python
model.save('models/caption_model.h5')
# Load
from keras.models import load_model
model = load_model('models/caption_model.h5')
```

---

## 📌 Notes

* Data: \[COCO/Flickr8k/Flickr30k or custom dataset]
* Evaluated using BLEU score.

```

If you'd like, I can **insert exact model names / dataset / functions** from your notebook—just say the word! 🚀
